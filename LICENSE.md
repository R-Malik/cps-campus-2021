## 1. Purpose and Scope

This License governs all use, modification, and redistribution of the Software and derivative works. It distinguishes between personal, non-commercial use by individuals and institutional use or redistribution. Contributors and institutions retain ownership of their original intellectual property, even when incorporated into the Software. Rahim Malik retains all access rights, licensing authority, and copyright over the Software itself and derivative works.

Nothing in this License requires users, contributors, or institutions to disclose, publish, or share modifications, derivative works, or usage details with Rahim Malik.

## 2. Copyright and Attribution

All copies and versions of the Software, whether original or modified, must clearly identify Rahim Malik as the copyright holder. The copyright field, such as in app stores, websites, or metadata, must list Rahim Malik as the holder. Within the Software itself, attribution must be displayed on the main tab, home screen, or landing page in a legible, high-contrast font. The text “Designed by Rahim Malik” must remain intact and unaltered. Attribution may not be hidden, minimized, or replaced by other branding. Failure to provide proper attribution or removal of copyright notices constitutes a violation of this License.

This attribution requirement is non-exclusive. Nothing in this License prohibits contributors, institutions, or other authors from crediting themselves or others for their respective contributions, provided that such attribution does not remove, replace, obscure, or diminish the required attribution to Rahim Malik or the copyright notices associated with the Software. Any additional attribution must not imply endorsement by Rahim Malik unless explicitly authorized.
